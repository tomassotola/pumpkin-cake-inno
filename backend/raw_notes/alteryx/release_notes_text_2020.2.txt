New Features
------------


#### Alteryx Analytics Hub


Connect Designer to your Alteryx Analytics Hub site so that you can quickly save and share your workflows with others. Visit [Connect to Alteryx Analytics Hub](/node/9806 "Connect to Alteryx Analytics Hub") to learn more.


#### Alteryx Intelligence Suite


The Alteryx Intelligence Suite is now available as a Designer add-on. Alteryx Intelligence Suite offers Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities on top of the great features that are already available with your Designer license. Visit [Alteryx Intelligence Suite](https://help.alteryx.com/current/designer/alteryx-intelligence-suite) to learn more.


#### Alteryx Multi-threaded Processing (AMP)


Alteryx Multi-threaded Processing (AMP) is a new architecture of Alteryx Engine, designed to work with larger volumes of data at higher velocity. To learn more about the AMP Engine as well as differences between the original engine and AMP, visit these resources:


* [Alteryx Engine](/20231/designer/alteryx-amp-engine "Alteryx Engine")
* [Alteryx Engine and AMP: Main Differences](/20231/designer/alteryx-engine-and-amp-main-differences "Alteryx Engine and AMP: Main Differences")
* [AMP Memory Use](/20231/designer/amp-memory-use "AMP Memory Use")


To run workflows with the AMP engine, navigate to the **Workflow**- **Configuration**pane in Designer and select the **Runtime**tab. Then check the **Use AMP Engine** box to enable Alteryx Multi-threaded Processing.


AMP Engine supports Standard, Iterative, and Batch Macros. In addition, 50 tools have been converted to run with AMP.


#### Smarter Data Profiling


Several updates and improvements were made to the **Browse** tool data profiling:


* The holistic view now shows the top values for each column of data. Use the toggle to switch between the top values view and the data profiling charts.
* For columns that contain only one distinct value across all rows, the *Only one value* message displays.
* For columns where each value is unique, the *All values are unique*message displays.
* You can now see value ranges at a glance in the holistic view for numerical and data-time columns.
* You can now see a list of up to 1,000 distinct top values via the **more >** link in the top values view.


#### Additional Enhancements


* Two new functions were added to the **Data Cleansing** tool: **Remove Null Rows** and **Remove Null Columns**.
* It's back! Due to popular demand, the **Open**, **Save**, **Cut**, **Copy**, **Paste**, **Undo**, and **Redo** functions were added to the [Designer toolbar](/20231/designer/main-menus "Designer toolbar").
* We made some updates to ensure a seamless, smooth experience when using Designer in a non-EN language.
	+ In-product help directs to content in the selected language.
	+ Search links to results in localized Community pages. Currently, this is supported for FR, DE, JP, ES, and PT languages.
	+ Canvas annotation font defaults to a supported language font when you switch to a different language.
* We added international support to the **DateTime** tool. Designer now supports dates and times in multiple languages and locale formats.
* The **Text Input** tool cell import limit was increased to 10,000.
* We made a few enhancements to the **Formula** tool:
	+ You can now delete formulas when they are collapsed in the Configuration window.
	+ When you double-click a column name inside of an expression, the brackets around the column name are also selected.
	+ Hover tooltips for functions were updated to improve accuracy and consistency.
* New One Model Examples are available in all supported languages. Download these via the [Licensing Portal](http://licenses.alteryx.com/ "Licensing Portal"). Select **Alteryx Designer** > **Alteryx Machine Learning Toolkit** and select a download option.
* R was upgraded to 3.6.3 from 3.5.3., discontinuing support for Microsoft R Client and Microsoft Machine Learning Server.
* CEF and Chromium were upgraded:
	+ CEF was upgraded to 3.3396.1786.gd3e36d0 from 3.3202.1694.gf061c23.
	+ Chromium was upgraded to 67.0.3396.79 from 62.0.3202.9400.
