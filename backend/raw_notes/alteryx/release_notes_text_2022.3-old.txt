Alteryx Designer version 2022.3 offers separate GA and [FIPS 140-2 capable](/20231/designer/alteryx-designer-fips "https://help.alteryx.com/current/designer/alteryx-designer-fips") products. For more information about FIPS, go to the [NIST FIPS FAQ page](https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips "https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips").


The general release version of Alteryx Designer is not FIPS capable. A separate release (and installer) is available under separate license terms, for our FIPS 140-2 customers.


#### Feature and Tool Differences


Please note that certain tools and features might be limited or not available in [Alteryx Designer-FIPS](/20231/designer/alteryx-designer-fips "https://help.alteryx.com/current/designer/alteryx-designer-fips"). Over time, we will continue to evaluate which tools and features to make available again in future Alteryx Designer-FIPS releases.




#### Upgrade Considerations: Designer–Server Compatibility



As is normally the case, if you upgrade Designer to 2022.3 and keep an older version of Server, you won’t be able to save workflows to Server (via Designer). You can only save them to Server via the Administrator UI or API.


#### New with the 2022.3 Release


If you upgrade Server to 2022.3 and keep Designer at version 2022.2 or prior, you'll encounter an error when you attempt to save a workflow from Designer to Server. You can only save them to Server via the Administrator UI or API.


Why? Server 2022.3 includes encryption improvements that are not compatible with previous versions of Designer. Due to the above-mentioned limitations, please make sure to upgrade Designer to 2022.3 if you upgrade Server to 2022.3.





#### Warning: Known Issue



Do not install Alteryx Designer FIPS to the same location as your non-FIPS Admin Designer.


By default, the FIPS installer recommends a different install location than the non-FIPS installer, but you can manually change it. If you change the install location, ensure it is NOT the same location as the non-FIPS Designer. If you install Alteryx Designer FIPS to the same location as a non-FIPS Admin Designer, your installation, as well as custom files and data that might be within that folder, will be significantly corrupted.




New Features: Designer
----------------------


#### OpenSSL3 Cryptographic Module Updates


* We’ve updated our bundled OpenSSL3 cryptographic engine to OpenSSL 3.0.7, which addresses CVE-3602 and CVE-3786, both rated as High Severity.
* We’ve bundled the OpenSSL3 Legacy Provider, which supplies older algorithms and ciphers (MD2, MD4, RC4, DES, IDEA, and others) that are no longer packaged as part of the core crypto engine in the 3.x series. Note that the Legacy Provider is not loaded unless it has been manually enabled via backend configuration on a particular Designer or Server host.


#### Installer Updates


As of the 2022.3 release, Alteryx Designer, Server, and the R Predictive tools use new installer technology. The updated installer detects your operating system language and installs Alteryx products in that language (if applicable). Go to [Download and Install a Product](/product-activation-and-licensing/download-and-install-product "Download and Install a Prodcut") for important upgrade and downgrade considerations and [review updated command-line options](/product-activation-and-licensing/use-command-line-options "updated command line options").


#### Search in Select


You can now perform a search in Designer tools that use the Select functionality. The search returns only the fields that match your search criteria—it searches the Field, Rename, and Description columns. You can then quickly select or deselect all the returned fields to perform actions on them, edit their data types, rename them, and more. We've also added a check box to let you quickly select and deselect all visible fields. Available in the Select, Join, Join Multiple, Append Fields, Select In-DB, Find Nearest, and Spatial Match tools.


#### Formula Tool Enhancements


We’ve added enhancements to the Formula tool. Each expression now contains an Expression ID number to assist with documenting and troubleshooting your expressions. Additionally, you can now quickly expand and collapse all expressions in the Formula tool via the expand all/collapse all toggle.


#### Multi Anchor Caching


You can now cache tools that have multiple output anchors (maximum of 5 anchors). This feature extends the caching functionality to over 50 additional tools. Please note that some tools (including those with more than 5 output anchors and In-DB tools) might still not be cacheable.


#### Disable Single Output Data Tool


You can now quickly disable a single Output Data tool while you develop your workflow or troubleshoot an issue. Use the **Disable Tool** check box in the tool’s configuration window. While disabled, the Output Data tool is shaded on the canvas to help visually indicate its disabled status.


#### Fuzzy Match Support for Japanese


We’ve added support for Japanese to the Fuzzy Match tool. You can now apply predefined match styles, that account for Japanese orthography, to Japanese addresses, names, or text.


#### Results Grid Accessibility Updates


We’ve made updates to the user interface of the Designer **Results** grid to improve accessibility via screen readers and other assistive technology. Buttons and controls that were previously only visible under certain conditions are now always visible, though inactive if not applicable.


#### Compare Workflow Enhancements


We've made improvements to the Compare Workflows feature. When you compare 2 workflows with container tools, if their enabled and disabled states are different, the Compare Workflows functionality identifies them as different.


#### Start Here Updates


We’ve rebuilt and updated the Start Here experience when you launch Designer. Start Here now launches in its own window rather than a tab on the Designer canvas. We’ll update the content periodically to highlight new features and updates in Designer. If you close the window, you can reopen it via **Help** > **Sample Workflows** > **Start Here**.


#### AMP Tool Support


With AMP, there are now 166 fully supported tools and 11 partially supported tools. The partially supported tools fall back to the original Engine for some unsupported functionality.


All Reporting and R tools are now AMP enabled (except the Insights Reporting tool).


There are 7 more AMP-only Connectors, with several more planned over the next few months, and even more planned for 2023\*, 1 new [Engines Parity tool](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Public-Community-Gallery/Engines-Parity-tool-Coming-Soon/ta-p/1009171 "Engines Parity tool"), 13 Reporting tools, and 65 R tools for a total of 86 newly supported AMP tools, including the R tool in the Developer category.


\*These Connector tools are available as AMP-only, and won't work with the original Engine: Azure Data Lake File Input, Azure Data Lake File Output, Microsoft Power BI Output, OneDrive Input, OneDrive Output, SharePoint Input, and SharePoint Output.


#### Proxy Support in AMP


Support for networking via proxy has been added to AMP. Support for SFTP over HTTP proxy has been added to both engines. The ability to bypass proxy has been enabled for both engines. You can now specify the Proxy Protocol Type (HTTP and SOCKS5h are supported) in User Settings and System Settings. If you don’t specify the protocol, the default is HTTP.


#### Engines Parity Utility


Engines Parity Utility is an easy way to compare the original Engine to AMP. It allows you to run both engines in parallel, evaluate the results, and make a decision about which workflow you can confidently convert to AMP. You can run Engines Parity Utility via the command line with AlteryxEngineCmd.exe or run it via Designer using the Gallery Macro download. For more information, go to [Engines Parity Utility](/20231/designer/engines-parity-utility "Parity Framework").


#### Sleep Method in R Scripts Is Not Needed Anymore


Prior to the 2022.3 release, there was a need in some cases to insert a *sleep* method in R Scripts to prevent script failure. Adding the call to Sys.sleep(0.1) helped to avoid an R error with loading Graphs. It pauses the execution of the R script for a tenth of a second, which should be enough time for the prior graph to be read by Alteryx before R attempts to send the next graph to Alteryx.


This was fixed for the original engine and AMP with the R conversion feature in 2022.3. You don't need to add the sleep method anymore.


#### Global Setting to Enable Allow-list for Peer Validation


As an admin with a non-FIPS Designer version, you are now able to specify a list of problematic hosts in a flat file for which peer validation will be skipped. If users encounter issues with certificate authorization, it does not need to stop the users from work. Go to [Peer Validation Allow List](/20231/designer/peer-validation-allow-list "Peer Validation Allow List") for more information.


#### Behavior Analysis Tools Deprecation


The Behavior Analysis tools in Alteryx Designer have been deprecated. These tools will continue to work with US Business Insights Data Packages 2021 Q4 and earlier versions.


#### DCM External Vault


The External Vault feature allows you to connect DCM with your Vault of choice. You can use External Vaults in DCM to fetch credentials from your Vault and securely use them in your workflow. For more information, go to [DCM External Vaults](/20231/designer/dcm-external-vaults "DCM External Vaults").


#### Google BigQuery Bulk Loading


Bulk loading to Google BigQuery is now available in the Output Data tool. It's supported with OAuth authentication using DCM. Data staging is done in Google Cloud Storage.


#### In-DB Support for Google BigQuery


Google BigQuery is now supported for the In-Database tools. It's supported with OAuth authentication using DCM and includes bulk loading for streaming-in data.


#### Email Tool OAuth Support


You can now authenticate to Microsoft Exchange Online with OAuth authentication via DCM and obtain a token pair that allows you to send emails from your Exchange Online account. For more information, go to [Email Tool](/20231/designer/email-tool "Email Tool").


#### Azure AD Support for Snowflake


You can now access and manage your Snowflake data with OAuth authentication via DCM. For more information, go to [Snowflake OAuth Authentication](/20231/designer/snowflake-oauth-authentication "Snowflake Azure AD Authentication").


#### Azure AD Support for Databricks


You can now access and manage (read/write/bulk write) your Databricks data via the private (single-tenant) and the public (multi-tenant) applications with OAuth authentication via DCM. For more information, go to [Databricks Azure OAuth Authentication.](/20231/designer/databricks-azure-oauth-authentication "Databricks Azure OAuth Authentication")


#### Connectors Deprecation


We’ve deprecated these connectors:


* Dynamics CRM Input and Output
* Google Sheets Input and Output
* Publish to Tableau Server
* Salesforce Einstein Analytics Output
* Salesforce Wave Output
* SharePoint List Input and Output


For more information, go to [Data Sources](/20231/designer/data-sources "Data Sources") or visit the [Community article](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Alteryx-Designer-Knowledge-Base/FAQs-Alteryx-Connectors-Deprecation-2022-3/ta-p/1041737).


#### Display Updates in Maps


The Mapbox logo and attribute text now appear at the bottom of the basemaps.


#### Usage Data Configuration


We have removed the configuration for sending usage data in the Designer User Settings. To read more about our philosophy on usage data, go to [Improving Our Products with Usage Data](/improving-our-products-usage-data "Improving Our Products with Usage Data") and the [Alteryx Privacy Policy](https://www.alteryx.com/privacy-policy "Alteryx Privacy Policy").


#### Improved Support for Multi-Byte Characters


We've made improvements to better support multi-byte characters, specifically characters that are common in Japanese data.


New Features: Intelligence Suite
--------------------------------


#### PDF to Text Tool


Extract text encoded as characters directly from your PDF files with >99% accuracy. Add OCR to extract text from images for additional coverage. In most cases, you’ll see an increase in accuracy, speed, and completeness compared to the Image to Text tool.


#### Zero-shot Text Classification Tool


Classify text into categories of your choice without the need for training data.


#### Text Summary Tool


Extract a summary of your text based on the TextRank methodology. You can specify the length of the summary by number of sentences.


#### Image Template Tool Enhancements


Added the ability to edit annotation bounding boxes in the Image Template tool. We enabled this functionality with mini-tate, a new open-source React library from Alteryx.


#### Shift Step in Image Processing Tool


Added a Shift step to the Image Processing tool. Shift automatically shifts documents into alignment based on a user-defined anchor. Use the Image Template tool to define the anchor with an annotation. Shift can improve OCR results for images that shifted during the scanning process.


#### Image Recognition Tool Enhancements


Added Evaluation Metrics and Model Report output anchors to the Image Recognition tool. Metrics include information on the precision, recall, and accuracy of each classification label. The report output includes loss and accuracy plots for each epoch. Use these plots to visualize if the tool sufficiently trained the model.
