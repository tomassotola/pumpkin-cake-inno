#### \*2021.4.2 Patch Update



Alteryx now gives you the ability to [patch your installation of Designer or Server](/product-activation-and-licensing/download-and-install-patch-update "patch your installation of Designer or Server") without the need to perform a full uninstall and reinstall.


The 21.4.2 Patches and all subsequent releases contain an important security fix for AMP Engine.


* If you previously installed the base version 2021.4.2.02731, please apply the most recent patch.
* For all other versions, please install the most recent full version (this version already includes the patch).


You can download both items from the [Downloads & Licences portal](https://downloads.alteryx.com/ "Downloads and Licenses portal"). For older patch versions, contact [Fulfillment](mailto:fulfillment@alteryx.com).


\*\*If you did not previously install version 2021.4.2.07064, you can install the latest patch, which includes the updates from 2021.4.2.07064.





#### Update: 2021.4.2 Release


We have released version 2021.4.2.02731 to address the issues identified in version 2021.4.1 (noted below).


#### 2021.4.1 Release


We have identified issues in the Alteryx 21.4.1 release that may impact the use of the product. In Designer, we have identified conditions where Excel data may not completely import and may not return an error. This issue and recommended resolution is documented in more detail [in our Community Knowledge Base](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Alteryx-Server-Knowledge-Base/Issues-in-2021-4-1/ta-p/904217 "here in our Community Knowledge Base").


If you have deployed 21.4.1 into production, we recommend confirming if you are impacted. We recommend [contacting technical support](https://alteryx-community.force.com/CustomerCasePortal/s/createrecord/New_Case_Portal_Case?lang=en "contact our technical support") for assistance if you are reverting 21.4.1 Server in production.


If you have downloaded but are not using 21.4.1 in production, our general recommendation is to upgrade to the now released 2021.4.2.02731 version.




#### Upgrade Considerations



Certain older versions of connectors are not compatible with Designer 2021.4. Go to [Designer Compatibility with Data Connectors](/designer/designer-compatibility-data-connectors "Designer Compatibility with Data Connectors") for an overview or refer to the release notes for individual connectors in the [Community Gallery](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Community-Gallery/ct-p/Community-gallery "Community Gallery"), and download the latest version to maintain compatibility with Designer.




New Features
------------


#### Link Designer with the Alteryx Platform


You can now [link Designer and the Alteryx Platform](/20231/designer/manage-alteryx-links "link Designer and the Alteryx Platform"). This lets you save your Designer workflows to the Platform as well as open workflows from the Platform in Designer.


#### XML Parse Tool Enhancement


The XML Parse tool now includes an option to not pass the original parsed field downstream.


#### Generate Support File


The tech support file now includes additional information, for example, system information, environment variables, engine logs, ODBC Drivers and Versions, and much more! Go to [Generate Support File](/20231/designer/generate-support-file "Generate Support File") to learn more about this feature.


#### Reserve Products for Specific Users (Admin-only)


Administrators can reserve product access for specific users via Reservation Groups. This ensures that users have access to the products and features that they need. Go to [Alteryx License Server Reservations](/product-activation-and-licensing/alteryx-license-server-reservations "Alteryx License Server Reservations") to learn more.


#### Public Gallery and Designer


You can no longer save workflows from Designer to Public Gallery. Go to the [Public Gallery Migration FAQ](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Alteryx-Community-Resources/Public-Gallery-Migration-FAQ/ta-p/832485 "https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Alteryx-Community-Resources/Public-Gallery-Migration-FAQ/ta-p/832485") to learn more.


#### Error Message Enhancements


Certain error messages in the Results window now link to Community articles that will help you understand and resolve the errors.


#### CEF Upgrade


We upgraded CEF to version 91.0.4472.124. You might encounter a blank screen when authenticating to OneDrive, Dropbox, Dataverse, Box, SharePoint, and Power BI Connectors. Please note that you need to update these connectors to resolve this issue. To learn more about Connector compatibility with Designer, go to [Designer Compatibility with Data Connectors](/designer/designer-compatibility-data-connectors "Designer Compatibility with Data Connectors").


#### New Intelligence Suite Tool


The Alteryx Intelligence Suite now includes a new Text Mining tool. The [Named Entity Recognition](/20221/designer/named-entity-recognition-%28archived%29 "Named Entity Recognition tool") tool allows you to train a model that identifies predefined or custom entities, like people, places, or things, in text data.


#### New Data Connectors


These Data Connector tools are now available:


* [Google Drive](/20231/designer/google-drive "Google Drive")
* [Anaplan](/20231/designer/anaplan "Anaplan")
* [Automation Anywhere](/20231/designer/automation-anywhere "Automation Anywhere")
* [Outlook 365](/20231/designer/microsoft-outlook-365 "Outlook 365")


#### Data Connection Manager (DCM)


Data Connection Manager (DCM) is the unified secure vault to store user credentials. Use DCM to improve security by moving your credentials outside the workflow and synchronizing them across the Alteryx product suite. To find out more about this new feature, go to the [DCM help page](/20231/designer/dcm-designer "DCM Help page").


#### Engine Compatibility Mode


Engine Compatibility Mode is a new workflow-level configuration option when it's necessary to maintain the order of output records from specific tools across both engines. It provides an easier migration path allowing users to bring workflows that expect specific record ordering from the original engine to AMP. Go to the [Engine Compatibility Mode help page](/20231/designer/engine-compatibility-mode "Engine Compatibility Mode help page") for more information.


#### Record Limit for All Inputs Support in AMP


The global setting Record Limit for all inputs is now supported by AMP. In the Workflow Configuration - Runtime tab, you can set the record limit in one place for all inputs.


#### Customer-Managed Telemetry


Instrument your Designer desktop installations to log workflow metadata and XML locally. You can use these logs to automate any number of processes, like change control or departmental utilization metrics. To maintain the highest expectations of customer privacy, these logs are customer-managed and are not sent to or logged by Alteryx.


### New in 2021.4.2.40860


#### Patch Number in About Pane


If you install a [Patch update](/product-activation-and-licensing/download-and-install-patch-update "Patch update") for Designer, you can now reference the Patch number in Designer via **Help** > **About**. The Patch number appears next to the Version number.
