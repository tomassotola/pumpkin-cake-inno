New Features
------------


#### Installation Experience Update


The current installation experience is now quicker due to the use of a new methodology. If you install this version and then decide to go back to a prior version (for example, you install version 2020.4 and then decide to go back to version 2020.3), you must uninstall this version through your operating system (OS) and then install the older version.


#### Find and Replace Window


You can now replace text in Designer via the **Find and Replace** window. Access this feature in the Designer main menu via **Edit** > **Find** or via the Ctrl + F keyboard shortcut. Visit [Find and Replace](/20231/designer/find-and-replace "Find and Replace") for more information.


#### Localization and International DateTime Support


* International DateTime support was added to the [Report Header](/20231/designer/report-header-tool "Report Header tool") and [Date Time Now](/20231/designer/date-time-now-tool "Date Time Now") tools, as well as the [DateTimeParse](/node/4456#datetimeparse "DateTimeParse") and [DateTimeFormat](/node/4456#datetimeformat "DateTimeFormat") functions.
* Calendar display mirrors Alteryx Designer language instead of OS language.
* Korean Code Page 949 was added to the Input Data tool.


#### Lock Workflow


The Encrypt Workflow feature is now called Lock Workflow. Additionally, you now need to acknowledge that you understand the Lock Workflow feature before you can lock your workflow.


#### Tool Conversions


The Dynamic Replace tool was converted to AMP. With AMP, you can now use these built-in macro tools: Select Records, Count Records, Weighted Average, Date Time Now, Random % Sample, and Create Samples. Additionally, the 17 Interface tools used in Analytic Apps have been converted to AMP.


We now have 74 fully converted and 14 partially converted tools for you to use with AMP. For more information about tools that have been converted from the original engine to AMP, visit [Tool Use with AMP.](/20231/designer/tool-use-amp "Tool Use with AMP")


#### Text Mining


* The Word Cloud tool has the option to **Generate Phrases**. If you select that option, the tool treats two-word phrases as single phrases.
* The Image to Text tool can parse PDFs that contain multiple languages.
* The Image Template tool has an extended markup field to accommodate more info.


#### Assisted Modeling


The Assisted Modeling tool has a new step. You can select whether you want the tool to walk you through each step in the modeling process or to build the model automatically.


#### Browse Tool Data Profiling


Several updates and improvements were made to the [**Browse** tool](/20231/designer/browse-tool "Browse tool") data profiling:


* Data Profiling in the Browse tool is now capped at 300 MB. This allows you to process very large datasets faster. For each record in the incoming dataset, we process the record and add the record size to a counter. Once the counter reaches 300MB, we stop processing records. It is important to note that there is no specific number of records we can process. The limit depends on the dataset since a record size can range from 1 byte to a few thousand bytes. This record size is different from the file size, displayed in the Results grid and Data Profiling Holistic View. The file size is generally different since it has been compressed to optimize spacing. In other words, 300 MB of record size is not the same as 300 MB of file size.
* We added a **Distincts** count for Float and Double data types.
* We updated the data type icons for all data types in Holistic Data Profiling.
* We now show a sample icon when a field in the dataset shows only a sample of the full dataset.
* You can now filter the Data Profiling Holistic view based on Fields (columns) and Data Types.


#### Email Events


You can now specify a port number for [Email Events](/20231/designer/workflow-configuration "Email Events"). The port number can still be added to the SMTP URL if needed.


#### Insight Tool


We fixed an issue that prevented users from creating filters in the Insights tool. Previously, the filter panel collapsed before a filter could be edited. This issue has been addressed.


#### Local Staging for Snowflake Bulk Loader


Previously, the Snowflake bulk loader only supported staging through an Amazon S3 bucket. You can now utilize Local Staging to stage data locally before it is copied to Snowflake. For more information, please visit [Snowflake Help](/20231/designer/snowflake "Snowflake Help").


#### PostgreSQL Bulk Loader


The PostgreSQL Bulk Loading functionality stages the data locally and performs a bulk copy operation for more performant writing to the database.


#### Teradata Upgrade to 16.20


Teradata driver version 16.20 is now supported.


#### XLSX Read and Write Support on AMP Engine


Users can now expect that XLSX files used in Input and Output tools will run with the AMP Engine when **Use AMP Engine** is selected.


#### One Tool Example for Insights Tool


A new One Tool Example (OTE) for the Insights tool is now available in Designer.


#### One Model Examples in Designer


One Model Examples, which feature tools from the Alteryx Intelligence Suite, are now built into Designer. Select **Help** > **Sample Workflows** > **Learn One Model at a Time**.
