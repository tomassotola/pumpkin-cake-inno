| 2021.2.1.35394 | May 17, 2021 | Major | November 17, 2022 |

| 2021.2.3.07036 | April 28, 2022 | Minor | November 17, 2022 |


New Features
------------


#### New Intelligence Suite Tools


The Alteryx Intelligence Suite now has Computer Vision tools. Use them to input, process, analyze, and then output images using Designer.


#### R Upgrade


We upgraded R to 4.0.4 from 3.6.3. The R 4.0 release features improvements in R's memory management, which means R can now work with more data without memory issues. Moving to the newer version allows our users who make use of custom R code in Alteryx to continue to be able to download binary installers of R packages from CRAN.


#### Separate Installer for Alteryx Intelligence Suite


Intelligence Suite is now installed separately from Designer. This improves the Designer install time while allowing users to quickly install Intelligence Suite.


#### Updated Trial Experience


We have updated the trial experience for new and current customers. Now, individuals can independently activate an Alteryx Intelligence Suite trial from the Alteryx Designer trial. Users that want to test Alteryx Intelligence Suite now have the ability to trial this functionality even if they already have a base Designer license.


#### Data Cleansing via the Results Grid


You can now perform data cleansing actions directly in the Results grid and apply these actions to your workflow via a preconfigured Data Cleanse tool. We also made some user interface updates to the Results grid to better organize the Data Cleanse, Filter, and Sort options.


#### Convert to Macro


You now have the option to convert an existing workflow (or a portion of the workflow) to a macro. Select at least one tool, right-click, and select **Convert to Macro** from the dropdown menu. Visit [Convert to Macro](https://help.alteryx.com/node/6251#convert-to-macro "Convert to Macro") to read about important limitations and additional instructions.


#### Global UID


Workflows (.yxmd, .yxmc, and .yxwz files) now track unique IDs in the XML. This includes the original workflow ID and the previous workflow ID. For example:


`<WorkflowId value="f8e90084-fca0-4c5d-9c0e-5fe614d78df1" />`  

`<Telemetry>`  

`<PreviousWorkflowId value="" />`  

`<OriginWorkflowId value="f8e90084-fca0-4c5d-9c0e-5fe614d78df1" />`  

`</Telemetry>`


#### Engine Asynchronous Logging


Local engine logs can now be written asynchronously for the original Engine. This improves performance, especially for administrators writing logs to a shared network file path.


#### Specify a Predictive Tools Code Page per Workflow


We’ve added Predictive Code Page settings to Workflow Configuration so that the predictive code page information gets saved within the workflow. This will avoid having workflows use different predictive code page settings based on the user's selected language.


#### Phonetic Sort Support for Kanji Characters


We’ve introduced more sorting methods available in the various areas of Designer that allow users to sort such as the Sort tool, IRG sorting behavior, Select tool, or any tool that has an embedded Select and Tile tool. These sorting methods include Pinyin, Gojūon, and Dictionary Order for all of our supported languages.


You can customize this setting via the [Localization User Settings](https://help.alteryx.com/node/6131#localization "Localization User Settings").


#### Updated Embedded Fonts in Predictive Macros


We’ve updated the hardcoded fonts that were embedded in Predictive macros. As a result, customers will avoid running into garbled results in their PDF reports. The font used supports the chosen language text of the user.


#### Topic Model Output


We've added an additional M output anchor to the Topic Modeling tool, which allows users to save models they can later use to make predictions about new data.


#### Google BigQuery Output Tool Updates


We updated the Google BigQuery Output tool to utilize bulk file write instead of streaming records to BigQuery. The tool now loads JSON files from the local machine into BigQuery. Please see the [release notes in Gallery](https://gallery.alteryx.com/#!app/Google-BigQuery-Tools/5b1f092a8a93372a64c28c09 "release notes in Gallery") provided for these tools for additional information.


#### Salesforce Input Tool Maintenance


We remedied defects in the Salesforce Input tool. Please see the [release notes in Gallery](https://gallery.alteryx.com/#!app/Salesforce-Input-Tool/59b84ccbeffc2a09d4057c43 "release notes in Gallery") provided for this tool for information.


#### Update SafeMode Error Message Text to Restricted


When attempting to run a workflow (in Server, Gallery, or AAH) that contains restricted tools when the Safe or Semi-Safe mode is set, users will now get different error messages returned. For example, "Restricted Environment Error: The R tool is prohibited based on current run mode settings."


#### Deadlock Prevention Part 2: Limit Connections for Join Multiple, Action Order for Summarize, and Increase the Number of Threads if Memory Is Increased


In the case where a workflow contained multiple of these tools (Join, Join Multiple, Summarize, Tile, and FuzzyMatch), and the memory limit was too small, there was a high chance that the engine went to a memory deadlock. Now, this issue is resolved.


#### One Tool Example Updates


We converted several workflows into One Tool Examples. You can now find these under **Help** > **Sample Workflows** > **Learn one tool at a time** > **Predictive**. These were previously found under **Help** > **Sample Workflows** > **Predictive Samples**.
