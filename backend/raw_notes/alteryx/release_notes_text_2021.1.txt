New Features
------------


#### Python Tool Base Folder Update for 2021.1.4


The Python tool base folder name was updated in version 2021.1.4. The folder is now called DesignerBaseTools\_vEnv. It was previously called Jupytertool\_vEnv.


#### Updates to Results Window Error Messages


We have updated the text for several error messages that you might encounter in the Designer Results window. These updates help you identify what caused the error and what you can do to prevent it. In addition, certain error messages are now clickable and will take you to a Community article with more information about the error and how to address it.


#### Licensing Update for Versions 11.7 and Older


You can’t upgrade *directly* from version 11.7 or older to version 2021.1. If you are using Designer version 11.7 or previous and want to upgrade to 2021.1, you have to first upgrade to version 2020.4 or previous. Then you can upgrade to 2021.1.


#### New Intelligence Suite Tools


The Alteryx Intelligence Suite has 4 new tools that help you assess the health of your data, set feature types, build features from multiple data streams, and automatically create machine learning models. The tools are AutoML, Build Features, Data Health, and Feature Types. You can find them in the Machine Learning category in Designer.


#### Text Pre-processing Tool Update


The Text Pre-processing tool now has a second input anchor that allows you to pass in lists of stop words.


#### Use AMP Engine for All New Workflows


You can now enable a [user setting](/node/6131 "User Setting") to use the AMP Engine for all new workflows that you create.


#### Designer Keyboard Navigation Upgrades


You can now navigate the tool palette with the keyboard and use the Enter key to place a tool on the canvas. You can also double-click a tool on the tool palette to add it to the canvas. Visit [Shortcuts in Alteryx Designer](/20231/designer/shortcuts-alteryx-designer "Shortcuts in Alteryx Designer") to read more about this feature.


#### Find and Replace Update


We made several updates to the user interface of the [Find and Replace window](/20231/designer/find-and-replace "Find and Replace window").


#### HTML Developer Tools


Users can now access [developer tools](/developer-help/html-developer-tools "developer tools") via **Options** > **Advanced Options** > **Show HTML Developer Tools**.


#### Download Tool Update


The [Download tool](/20231/designer/download-tool "Download tool") now has a **Throttle Records** checkbox. Use this to indicate the number of records that you want to pass through the tool per minute.


#### Analytic Applications Support in AMP


The running of Analytic Applications is already well utilized with the original engine. Now there is support for Analytic Applications with AMP.


#### Build Custom Formula Functions on AMP Using XML


As a Designer user working with AMP, you can now use Custom Formula Functions. You can now create specific functions with XML files and use them in workflows with AMP.


#### Prevent Deadlocks for Grouping and Blocking Tools with AMP


When you build and run workflows that contain grouping and blocking tools (Join, Join Multiple, Tile, Fuzzy Match, Sorting, etc.) with a low memory limit set, you won’t experience the hang issue on the Join tool anymore.


#### Improved Error Messaging when Connecting to Alteryx Analytics Hub


If you encounter an error when you connect Designer to Alteryx Analytics Hub, improved messaging lets you know what action you need to take to resolve the error.


#### New Localization User Setting


You can now customize the date format that displays in the **Messages** tab of the **Results** window.


#### New One Tool Examples


New [One Tool Examples](/node/6381#tools-with-a-one-tool-example "One Tool Examples") are available for tools in the Predictive, Time Series, AB Analysis, Data Investigation, and Machine Learning tool categories.


#### New One Model Example


A new [One Model Example](/node/6381#learn-one-model-at-a-time "One Model Example") is available for Text Mining tools.


#### Updated Version of Hyper API


We updated the version of Hyper API to V0.0.11889. Users can now see increased performance when reading and writing Hyper files.


#### Snowflake Internal Stage Bulkloader Upgrade


We added options to Snowflake Bulk Loader (Local Staging). This allows users to select how to chunk and compress files for bulk loading and can increase performance.
