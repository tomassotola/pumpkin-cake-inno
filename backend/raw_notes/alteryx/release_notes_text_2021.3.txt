#### 2021.3.1 Issue



The Alteryx Designer 2021.3.1 release contained a defect that prevents users from publishing new workflows with a Gallery Data Connection to Alteryx Server. We immediately addressed this defect with the 2021.3.2 release. Note that you do not need to upgrade Alteryx Server.




New Features
------------


#### Runner Tool (Sep 23, 2021)


Version 1.1.0: Released September 23, 2021. The Runner tool has been moved to the Developer tool category. It is now distributed as a YXZP file. For more information and installation instructions, go to the [Runner tool help page](/20231/designer/runner-tool "Runner tool help page").


#### Compare Workflows


Use the [Compare Workflows](/20231/designer/compare-workflows "Compare Workflows") feature to compare 2 workflows and quickly identify the differences via visual indicators. You can access this feature via **Options** > **Advanced Options** in Alteryx Designer.


#### Recommended Tools


The new [Recommended tab](/20231/designer/recommended-tool-category "Recommended tab") in the Designer tool palette suggests tools that you can use while you build out your workflow. Select a tool on your canvas and the Recommended tab displays 6 common downstream tools that typically follow the selected tool.


#### New Intelligence Suite Tools


The Alteryx Intelligence Suite now includes 2 new Computer Vision tools. The Image Profile tool allows you to extract helpful information from images, and the Image Recognition tool lets you train a machine learning model to classify images.


#### Tool Container Enhancements


We made some updates to the Tool Container tool. Now, when you disable a Tool Container, the disabled container remains expanded on the canvas and appears dimmed to indicate the disabled state. You can collapse a disabled container to hide its contents. Select the expand/collapse icon within the tool container to do so.


#### Performance Profiling with AMP Engine


To optimize your workflow when building workflows with AMP, you can now analyze the performance of specific tools with Performance Profiling with AMP. You can turn on profiling with the **Enable Performance Profiling** checkbox in the Workflow Configuration Runtime settings. For more information, visit the [Performance Profiling with AMP Engine](/20231/designer/performance-profiling-amp-engine "Performance Profiling with AMP Engine") help page.


#### Microsoft Power BI


We made updates to the Microsoft Power BI connector:


* Built-in multitenant Azure App with an option to use a custom Azure App.
* Supports multiple table inputs.
* Keeps existing dataset and its structure with updating and overwriting data.
* Users can select which workspace to work with.
* Proxy support.


#### Generate Support File


Generate a tech support file that contains information that helps our Customer Support Engineers properly troubleshoot your issue. You can upload this file when you submit your support case. Make sure to review the file contents and remove anything you might not want to include.


#### End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy


The Alteryx End User License Agreement (EULA) and Alteryx Privacy Policy are now accessible via the Help menu in Designer.


#### Auto Insights Uploader Tool Available via the In/Out Tool Category (version 2021.3.6.01129)


Starting with version 2021.3.6.01129, the [Auto Insights Uploader tool](/20231/designer/auto-insights-uploader-tool "Auto Insights Uploader tool") is now a default tool in Alteryx Designer. You can access **Auto Insights Uploader** via the **In/Out**tool category.


#### End of Support for 32-bit Database Connections


Alteryx Designer 2021.2 is the last version with the functionality to connect to 32-bit data sources. If you are currently using 32-bit connections, you will not be able to use those connections in 2021.3. See the [End of Support for 32-Bit Database Connections FAQs](/20231/designer/end-support-32-bit-database-connections-faqs) for more details.
