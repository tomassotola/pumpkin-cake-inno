 2023.1

Last modified: October 04, 2023




| Release Note Product Versions |
| --- |
| Version | Release Date | Release | End of Support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2023.1.1.123 | May 17, 2023 | Major | May 17, 2025 |
| 2023.1.1.200 (Patch 1) | June 21, 2023 | Minor/Patch | May 17, 2025 |
| 2023.1.1.247 (Patch 2) | August 22, 2023 | Minor/Patch | May 17, 2025 |



#### Urgent: Reinstall AIS 23.1



We've made a change to the Alteryx Intelligence Suite (2023.1) installer due to a compiling issue in Build 2023.1.17039. Please download and reinstall the latest Alteryx Intelligence Suite Build 2023.1.0.17033 from the [license portal](https://us1.alteryxcloud.com/license-portal/).





Alteryx Designer version 2023.1 offers separate GA and [FIPS 140-2 capable](/20231/designer/alteryx-designer-fips "https://help.alteryx.com/current/designer/alteryx-designer-fips") products. For more information about FIPS, go to the [NIST FIPS FAQ page](https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips "https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips").


The general release version of Alteryx Designer is not FIPS capable. A separate release (and installer) is available under separate license terms for our FIPS 140-2 customers.


#### Feature and Tool Differences


Please note that specific tools and features might be limited or unavailable in [Alteryx Designer-FIPS](/20231/designer/alteryx-designer-fips "https://help.alteryx.com/current/designer/alteryx-designer-fips"). Over time, we will continue to evaluate which tools and features to make available again in future Alteryx Designer-FIPS releases.




#### Warning: Known Issue



Do not install Alteryx Designer FIPS in the same location as your non-FIPS Admin Designer.


By default, the FIPS installer recommends a different install location than the non-FIPS installer, but you can manually change it. If you change the install location, ensure it is NOT the same location as the non-FIPS Designer. If you install Alteryx Designer FIPS to the same location as a non-FIPS Admin Designer, your installation, as well as custom files and data that might be within that folder, will be significantly corrupted.




New Features: Designer
----------------------


### Cloud Execution for Desktop


[Cloud Execution for Desktop](/20231/designer/cloud-execution-desktop "Cloud Execution for Desktop") is now available for Designer version 2023.1 (included in the 2023.1.1.200 Patch 1 release).


Schedule and run your Designer Desktop-built workflows in the cloud. Cloud Execution for Desktop lets you link your Alteryx Designer Desktop instance to an Alteryx Analytics Cloud Platform (AACP) workspace and then save your desktop-built workflows to the AACP library (which belongs to your AACP workspace). Once saved to the library, you can navigate to AACP and schedule those workflows to run.


### New Tool: Control Containers


The [Control Container tool](/20231/designer/control-container-tool "Control Container tool") is a brand new tool available via the Developer tool category in Designer. Control Containers allow you to build more dynamic and complex processes with better orchestration, logging, and conditional execution.


Here are just some of the capabilities of Control Containers:


* Manage the sequence in which tools run in your workflow. For example, you can use Control Containers to sequence outputs to different sheets within the same Excel workbook or even output a file in a workflow and use that same file as input later in the same workflow!
* Conditionally execute workflow branches—use a Filter tool to execute a branch of your workflow depending on whether records pass through the True or False outputs.
* Use information about the tools that are run, either as logging information or as data to use in your workflow. For example, you can use Control Containers to create an output log for a workflow. Place all tools inside the container, and then output a file from the container’s Logging Output anchor to display the messages from your workflow execution.



#### AMP Only



The Control Container tool is only compatible with [Alteryx Multi-threaded Processing (AMP)](/20231/designer/alteryx-amp-engine "Alteryx Multi-threaded Processing").




### New Formula Functions


We’ve added several new [formula functions](/20231/designer/functions "formula functions"):


* AverageNonNull (Math Category)
* Between (Min/Max Category)
* Ceil and Floor functions have a new optional parameter to let you raise/lower numeric values to the nearest specified multiple (Math Category).
* Factorial (Math Category)
* ToRadians and ToDegrees (Conversion Category)


You can use these anywhere functions are available.


### Higher Precision DateTime


You can now specify additional precision for your [DateTime and Time data types](/20231/designer/data-types "data types"). This allows for higher precision than seconds—for example, milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds, etc.


* A new **f** parameter is now available via the [DateTime tool](/20231/designer/datetime-tool "DateTime tool") and lets you set precision time.
* A new **%1-%18** [date-time specifier](/20231/designer/datetime-functions#specifiers "date-time specifier") is available with the DateTimeFormat and DateTimeParse functions.
* Higher precision is available via the DateTimeAdd, DateTimeDiff, DateTimeFormat, DateTimeNow, DateTimeParse, and DateTimeSeconds functions. Go to [DateTime Functions](/20231/designer/datetime-functions "DateTime Functions") for details.
* A new DateTimeNowPrecise function is now available. This function returns your operating system's current date-time with digits of precision that you specify via the parameter.
* You can now also use the [Select tool](/20231/designer/select-tool "Select tool") (and other tools with embedded select functionality) to adjust the size of DateTime and Time data to contain your desired precision. This functionality is also available via other tools where you can select field size, like Formula and Generate Rows.


### Force SQL WChar Support via Output Data Tool


The Force SQL WChar Support option is now available via the Output Data tool for Oracle OCI connections. This option lets you force all char fields to output to WString to handle multi-byte characters.


### Render Tool Data Truncation Fixes


We’ve made an update to help prevent unexpected data truncation in the Render tool. You’ll now encounter an error message when you try to output to PDF when the page size is too small to accommodate the data in your dataset.


### Field Name Case Change Updates


To improve the workflow creation process, we've made updates to ensure that changes to the case of a field/column name will propagate to downstream tools without the need for manual reconfiguration. This update doesn’t apply to tools that are macros and doesn’t affect tools that use a pop-out configuration dialog (for example, the Insight and Interactive Chart tools).


Note that this change doesn't affect the Engine, nor does it affect how a workflow executes. Field names have always been case-insensitive from an Engine perspective unless otherwise specified.


### Dark Mode BETA


Alteryx Designer now lets you select a [Dark Mode](/20231/designer/dark-mode "Dark Mode") option as your Designer theme! Preview Dark Mode via the Customization tab of Designer's User Settings.



#### BETA Release



The initial release of Dark Mode is a Beta release. Only certain Designer interface components have been converted to Dark Mode. Additionally, you might see certain components (including many tool configurations) that are currently only partially converted to Dark Mode. We will continue to include additional elements for Dark Mode in future releases.




### Denodo Support


Alteryx now supports the Denodo platform connection. You can use standard workflow processing and In-Database workflow processing tools to read and write your data. For more information, go to [Denodo](/designer/denodo "Denodo").


### Okta Authentication Support for SAP Hana


The 2023.1 release brings Okta authentication support, single sign-on (SSO), for SAP Hana. You can now authenticate to SAP Hana Cloud with Okta accounts.


### AWS Secrets Manager


You can now connect DCM to your AWS Secrets Manager instance and then fetch authentication data from AWS Secrets Manager for your workflow. For information on how to configure AWS Secrets Manager, go to [AWS Secrets Manager Configuration](/designer/aws-secrets-manager-configuration "AWS Secrets Manager Configuration").


### DCM as Default Option


DCM is now set as **Enabled** and **Default** in **System Settings** and **Enabled** in **User Settings**. Also, **SDK** is set to **Allow****,** and the DCM check box is checked on a tool level.


If you upgrade from versions after 21.4, your DCM settings reflect the setup from your previous installation.


### Microsoft Access Support


Alteryx now supports the MS Access 2016 Runtime and the MS Access 365 Runtime for reading ACCDB files.


### IAM Role Support for S3 Tools


In the S3 Download and S3 Upload tools, you can now select the Assume Role option as a new authentication method to fully leverage roles in your AWS IAM.


### New in 23.1 Patch 3


We implemented DSN-less connection strings for Snowflake bulk loading for local staging and staging in Amazon S3.


New Features: Predictive Tools
------------------------------


### R Tool Upgrade


Upgraded R to 4.2.3 from 4.1.3 in Patch 2023.1.1.200. Go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.2.3/NEWS.R-4.2.3.html) to find out what is new in R. Follow [this guide](https://alteryx.my.site.com/knowledgecenter/s/article/How-To-Use-the-R-Tool-with-Packages-Compatible-with-R-Version-423) to download and install the new version to make use of custom R code in Designer. The new version lets you continue to download R packages from CRAN.


New Features: Intelligence Suite
--------------------------------


### Machine Learning Integration Tools Update


* Moved the Machine Learning Predict tool from the Laboratory tool category to the Machine Learning tool category.
* Updated the Machine Learning Predict and Send tool icons to represent cloud connections.
* Download the latest 2023.1 version of the ML integration tools [here](https://us1.alteryxcloud.com/license-portal/). To locate the download, go to **Alteryx Intelligence Suite** > **Download** > **Alteryx Intelligence Suite 2023.1** > **Next** > **Alteryx Machine Learning Designer Integration Tools**.


### Installer Updates


As of the 2023.1 release, Alteryx Intelligence Suite uses new installer technology. The updated installer detects your operating system language and installs the product in that language (if applicable).


### Text Classification Tool


Use the Text Classification tool to build a custom model that classifies text. Label your text data with categories to train a model and then classify new text with the Predict tool.


### Enhance Step in Image Processing Tool


Added an image enhancement step to the Image Processing tool. **Enhance** increases image resolution of your scanned documents. Use **Enhance** to improve the results of your computer vision tasks.


### Auto Option Added to Alignment Step in Image Processing Tool


Auto to automatically align your scanned documents in your OCR workflows.


### Apply Annotations to All Pages


Added an **Apply First Page of Annotations in Image Template to All Pages** checkbox to the PDF to Text and Image to Text tools. Use this checkbox to apply the first page of annotations from the Image Template tool to all pages in batch processing.


End of Support
--------------


### End of Extended Support Period for 32-bit Connections


For a period of two years from the date of release of Alteryx version 2021.2 (the "Extended Support Period"), Alteryx was providing customer technical support for 32-bit connections. If you currently use 32-bit connections, you will get an error message and will no longer be able to use those connections. Go to [End of Support for 32-Bit Database Connections FAQs](/20231/designer/end-support-32-bit-database-connections-faqs) for more details.
