New Features
------------


#### Publish to Public Gallery


* Gallery Artisans can now see an additional confirmation dialog when they select **Sharing** > **Place in Public Gallery**. This reminds users content is being publicly shared in the Public Gallery.
* Additionally, when users select **Save As** in Designer, they will now see explicit options for **Private Gallery** and **Public Gallery**.


#### Localization Updates


* Simplified Chinese is now available in Designer, making it the 8th supported language.
* You can now toggle to any one of our 8 supported languages within Designer. Access all supported languages and **Localization Settings** via the globe icon next to **Help** in the main menu.
* You can now sort your tool palette to follow **English Alphabetical** order, even if you're using a non-EN user interface. Access this new feature via globe icon > **Localization Settings** > **Tool Palette Order**. We do not yet support the sorting of Kanji characters.


#### Excel Enhancements


Several enhancements related to Excel file input are now available:


* When you select a .xlsx or .xlsm Excel file in the Input Data and the Output Data tools, you can now select a range for cells, rows, or columns.
* The **Excel Input** screen now has a **Refresh** button. If you can't input an Excel sheet because the file is open in Excel, you can now close the file and select **Refresh** from the **Excel Input** screen without closing and reopening the screen.
* The **List of Sheet Names** option in the Input Data tool for .xlsx files now returns the sheet names in the order they appear in Excel.
* You can now **Preserve Formatting on Overwrite** when overwriting a sheet or range via the Output Data tool **Options**. In order to preserve formatting, you have to:
	+ Select **Overwrite Sheet or Range** via **Output Options**.
	+ Specify cell ranges in the output file path.


#### Smarter Data Profiling


Holistic profiling allows you to view profiling for multiple columns at once in a single view in the Browse tool.


#### Additional Enhancements


* The following keyboard shortcuts are now available in Designer:
	+ **Select the Tool Palette**: Ctrl + Shift + T
	+ **Select the Overview panel**: Ctrl + Shift + V
	+ **Select the Results panel**: Ctrl + Shift + G (results grid)
	+ **Select the Configuration panel**: Ctrl + Shift + C
	+ **Select the Canvas:** Ctrl + Shift + W
	+ **Select the Interface Designer Window:** Ctrl + Shift + D
* New one tool examples are available in In/Out, Preparation, Transform, Interface, Calgary, and Developer tool categories.
	+ In/Out: Date Time Now
	+ Preparation: Create Samples, Oversample Field
	+ Transform: Arrange, Weighted Average
	+ Interface: Control Parameter, Folder Browse, Macro Input, Macro Output
	+ Calgary: Calgary Input, Calgary Join, Calgary Cross Count, Calgary Cross Count Append, Calgary Loader
	+ Developer: API Output, Detour, Detour End, Python, Run Command
* When you select a single tool on your canvas, the F2 key on your keyboard now opens the tool's **Annotation** configuration window with the cursor placed in the **Annotation** text field.
* The font size of container names is no longer oversized when printing a workflow.
* Macro Input questions are no longer deleted from the XML when they are cached.
* **Comments** inside tool containers no longer hide tools.
* The join order (Input\_#1, Input\_#2, etc.) in the Join Multiple tool is now maintained after saving.
* You can now resize column widths in the tool configuration window. This is particularly helpful when working with long field names in the Join, Append Fields, and Join Multiple tools that previously required you to expand the configuration panel in order to see all columns.
* You can now change the color of the input string number so that it is visible when opting into a darkened canvas in Designer. Go to **User Settings** > **Canvas** > **Connection Settings** > **Text Color**.
* You can now open multiple copies of the same workflow again by selecting **Allow multiple tabs of the same file to be open** in **User Settings** or by selecting the Shift key while opening a file to open more than one of them.
