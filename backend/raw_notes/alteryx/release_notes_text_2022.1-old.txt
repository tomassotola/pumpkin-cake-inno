Important Notes and Updates
---------------------------



#### \*2022.1.1.30569 Patch Release Update



The 2022.1.1.30569 Patch/Minor release has been removed from the Download Portal due to a missing signature in some of the included files. This causes the files to not be recognized as valid files provided by Alteryx and might trigger warning messages by some 3rd party programs.


If you installed the 2022.1.1.30569 release, we recommend that you install the latest patch. You don't need to uninstall 2022.1.1.30569.





#### Warning: Known Issue



Do not install Alteryx Designer FIPS to the same location as your non-FIPS Admin Designer.


By default, the FIPS installer recommends a different install location than the non-FIPS installer, but you can manually change it. If you change the install location, ensure it is NOT the same location as the non-FIPS Designer. If you install Alteryx Designer FIPS to the same location as a non-FIPS Admin Designer, your installation, as well as custom files and data that might be within that folder, will be significantly corrupted.





#### Patch Updates



Alteryx now gives you the ability to [patch your installation of Designer or Server](/product-activation-and-licensing/download-and-install-patch-update "patch your installation of Designer or Server") without the need to perform a full uninstall and reinstall. You can download the patch from the [Downloads & Licenses portal](https://downloads.alteryx.com/ "Downloads and Licenses portal"). For older patch versions, contact [Fulfillment](mailto:fulfillment@alteryx.com).





#### TCPE-120



Issue TCPE-120 was originally reported as Fixed. Further investigation has determined that this issue persists. As a result, TCPE-120 has been moved into the Known issues section. We apologize for the trouble and are working to fix this issue for a future release.




Alteryx Designer FIPS
---------------------


Alteryx Designer FIPS version 2022.1 is the first release of Designer that offers a [FIPS 140-2 capable option](/20231/designer/alteryx-designer-fips "FIPS 140-2 compliant option") for customers that require FIPS compliance. Please note that these standards are developed by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for use by US government agencies and contractors. For more information about FIPS, go to the [NIST FIPS FAQ page](https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips "https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips").


The general release version of Alteryx Designer is not FIPS capable. A separate release (and installer\*) is available under separate license terms, for our FIPS 140-2 customers.


\*Alteryx Designer FIPS uses new installer technology. As a result, the installation experience is different than what you might be familiar with when installing other Alteryx products.



#### Feature and Tool Differences



With the [Alteryx Designer FIPS 2022.1](/20231/designer/alteryx-designer-fips "Alteryx Designer FIPS") release, certain Designer tools and features are either not available or offer limited functionality. Over time, we plan to make many of these tools and features available again in future Alteryx Designer FIPS releases.




New Features: Designer
----------------------


#### AMP as Default Engine


AMP is now the default Engine for any new workflows you create. However, you can still choose the engine for your workflows via the workflow-level setting. Go to the Workflow - Configuration pane in Designer and select the Runtime tab. Next, enable or disable the Use AMP Engine check box to make your engine selection.


Please note that when you launch the 22.1 version of Designer, you’ll be greeted with a pop-up to notify you that AMP is the default for new workflows. You can then select to not show the message again if you choose.


Alteryx Multi-threaded Processing (AMP) is a new architecture of Alteryx Engine, designed to work with larger volumes of data at a higher velocity. To learn more about the AMP Engine, as well as the differences between the original engine and AMP, visit these resources:


* [Alteryx AMP Engine](/20231/designer/alteryx-amp-engine "Alteryx Engine")
* [Alteryx Engine and AMP: Main Differences](/20231/designer/alteryx-engine-and-amp-main-differences "Alteryx Engine and AMP: Main Differences")
* [Tool Use with AMP](/20231/designer/tool-use-amp "Tool Use with AMP")
* [AMP Memory Use](/20231/designer/amp-memory-use "AMP Memory Use")


AMP Engine supports Standard, Iterative, and Batch Macros. In addition, over 85 tools have been converted to run with AMP. Tools that haven’t been converted will automatically use the original Engine.


#### Field Limit for Input and Output Data with Original Engine and AMP


For Input and Output data, there is now a 32,000 upper limit of fields per record for both the original Engine and AMP.


* When read/write data is less than or equal to 32,000 fields, a valid workflow runs successfully.
* When read/write data exceeds 32,000 fields, an error is returned on a workflow run to indicate that the max number of fields was exceeded: "Error - Number of fields is larger than the 32,000 limit. Please reduce the number of fields."


#### AMP Grouping Framework Changes


The grouping framework on AMP Engine has been changed to behave similarly to the original Engine. This affects the Summarize, Join, and Join Multiple tools.


#### Designer User Interface Improvements


We’ve updated the Designer UI to better align with other Alteryx products. As part of the refresh, you’ll notice new fonts, colors, and icons—all part of a more modern look and feel.


One notable change is that when you run your workflow, you’ll no longer see the text "(Running)" in your workflow tab. Instead, you'll see a spinning/loading icon in the tab, beside the title of your workflow.


#### Auto Insights Uploader


The [Auto Insights Uploader tool](/20231/designer/auto-insights-uploader-tool "Auto Insights Uploader tool") is now a default tool in Alteryx Designer. You can access **Auto Insights Uploader** via the **In/Out**tool category.


#### DCM Connection Tool


The [DCM Connection tool](/20231/designer/dcm-connection-tool "DCM Connection tool") is a new tool within the **Interface** tools family. With the **DCM Connection tool**, you can display a prompt in an app or macro, and allow the user to pick a Connection from their DCM storage.


#### Databricks Delta Lake Support


There is new functionality that supports [Delta tables on Databricks](/20231/designer/databricks "Delta tables on Databricks"). You can use interactive or SQL Endpoint clusters on AWS and Azure. Bulk loading is supported with data staging in AWS S3 or Azure ADLS.


#### Updated Gallery References to Server


We have replaced any references to "Gallery" inside of Designer to instead reference "Server" and thus align with recent terminology updates to the Alteryx Server product.


New Features: Predictive Tools
------------------------------


#### R Tool Upgrade


We upgraded R to 4.1.3 from 4.0.5. Go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.1.3/NEWS.R-4.1.3.html) to find out what is new in R. [Download](https://downloads.alteryx.com/) and install the new version to make use of custom R code in Designer. The new version lets you continue to download R packages from CRAN.


New Features: Intelligence Suite
--------------------------------


#### Part-of-Speech Tagger Tool


The [Part-of-Speech Tagger tool](/20231/designer/part-speech-tagger "Part-of-Speech Tagger tool") allows you to determine a given word's part of speech. You can analyze specific parts of speech and refine outcomes for other **Text Mining** tools. For example, you can create word clouds of only verbs or topic models with just nouns.


#### Barcode Tool


The [Barcode tool](/20231/designer/barcode "Barcode tool") extracts information stored in QR codes and barcodes. The tool can also generate QR codes and barcodes. You can extract underlying information in QR codes and barcodes to automate business processes. For example, some companies use QR codes to determine whether documents are relevant to certain departments, then organize documents by Finance, HR, Marketing, etc. accordingly.


#### OCR Optimization Feature in the Image Processing Tool


We added an OCR Optimization feature to the Image Processing tool for scanned PDFs. Use the OCR Optimization step to pre-process noisy, scanned PDFs (for example, scanned documents that contain non-white or textured backgrounds and watermarks) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This additional step can greatly improve the Key-Value Pair tool results.


#### Key-Value Pair Extraction Tool


The [Key-Value Pair Extraction tool](/20231/designer/key-value-pair-extraction "Key-Value Pair tool") links 2 data elements, a key, which defines the data set, and its value, which belongs to the dataset. For example:


* Company: Alteryx
	+ "Company" is the key.
	+ "Alteryx" is the value of the key "Company."


#### OCR Speed Optimization


Introduced performance improvements to the **Image Input** and **Image to Text** tools that can make your workflows run even faster! You might notice significant improvements (up to a 40% speed increase) when you parse larger documents such as multi-page PDFs.


New Features: Installation and Licensing
----------------------------------------


#### Alteryx License Server


We have streamlined the activation process with Alteryx License Server so you can focus on the available products by removing license keys from view.


#### New Options for AlteryxActivateLicenseKeyCmd


We have added an option to update the trusted storage with the information on the License Server. We have also added an option to return the current configuration including licensing mode, email address, and License Server URL, if applicable.


### New in 2022.1.1.40869


#### Patch Number in About Pane


If you install a [Patch update](/product-activation-and-licensing/download-and-install-patch-update "Patch update") for Designer, you can now reference the Patch number in Designer via **Help** > **About**. The Patch number appears next to the Version number.
