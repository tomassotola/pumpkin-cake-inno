New Features
------------



To address security vulnerabilities in Python version 3.6, [embedded Python](/20231/designer/alteryx-embedded-python "embedded Python") has been upgraded from 3.6.8 in the 20.3 release to 3.8.5 in the 20.4 release. Custom tools and connectors (YXI files) developed by Alteryx, partners, or any 3rd party that don't ship with the Alteryx installer might need to be reinstalled. This impacts custom tools installed on Designer, Server, and Alteryx Analytics Hub.



#### Installation Experience Update


The current installation experience is now quicker due to the use of a new methodology. If you install this version and then decide to go back to a prior version (for example, you install version 2020.4 and then decide to go back to version 2020.3), you must uninstall this version through your operating system (OS) and then install the older version.


#### Select Alteryx Analytics Hub Upload Location in Designer


When you upload to AAH from Designer, you can now save to a location other than your personal folder. To do so from Alteryx Designer, select **Save As** > **Analytics Hub** and choose your AAH instance. Use the **Select** button next to the **Location** field and choose where you want to save your workflow. Note that only folders that you have permission to write to are available to select.


#### Designer Updates


We made several updates to Alteryx Designer to improve performance and usability:


* You can now select and copy the Alteryx Designer version text (first 3 lines) from the version pop-up window accessed via **Help** > **About**.
* The Select tool now auto-sizes the **Field** column to fit field names without cutting off any text (up to 40 characters).
* We made a performance improvement to the Data Cleansing tool. We now allow quotes in the field name.
* We no longer store the tool, container, and comment position and width/height as floating-point values, but rather as integers.


#### Results Window Toolbar Updates


The toolbar in the Designer **Results** window was updated.


* The **Apply**and **Cancel Data Manipulations** icons were moved to the middle of the toolbar.
* The export, copy, and new window options were consolidated under a single **Actions** menu item.


#### Sample Datasets


Sample Datasets are now accessible directly via the Designer Help menu. Go to **Help** > **Sample Datasets**.


#### Learn More about AMP Engine


When the workflow type is Macro, the **Runtime** tab is now available via the **Workflow Configuration** window. The Runtime tab gives you access to the **Use AMP Engine** setting so you can build macros with AMP. Additionally, we added inline links to AMP help content in the Runtime tab as well as the Workflow Complete dialog.


#### Adobe Analytics Authentication Update


When you use the Adobe Analytics tool, you can now authenticate with [Adobe.io](http://adobe.io/ "Adobe.io") credentials for user authentication and JWT for service account authentication.


#### Sort/Join Memory and Threads Improvements


To efficiently utilize the maximum amount of memory when you run your workflows, you can set the **Memory Limit** and **Default Number of Processing Threads**. Navigate to the **Engine - General** tab in System Settings, the **Defaults** tab in **User Settings**, or the **Runtime** tab in **Workflow Configuration**.


#### Complete Formula Function Support in AMP


All built-in Formula functions available in the **Formula**, **MultiRowFormula**, and **MultiFieldFormula** tools in Designer are now supported with AMP.


#### Additional AMP Tools


With AMP, you can now run the **Summarize** and **Download** tools with full functionality.


* The Download tool now supports all code pages listed in Designer GUI.
* The Summarize tool supports these additional actions: Spatial Combine, Spatial Create Intersection.


#### CSV Reading and Writing with Code Pages in AMP


When you use CSV file types in the Input and Output Data tools with AMP, you can now rely on additional code page support without fallback to the Original Engine.


#### Strings Transcoding for AMP


You are now able to transcode strings from different code pages. Visit [Code Pages](/20231/designer/code-pages "Code Pages") for a list of supported encodings/code pages.


#### International Numeric Display Support


There are 2 new settings that you can customize to change how numbers display in Designer: **Thousand Separator** and **Decimal Symbol**. These settings affect how numbers display on the Designer canvas, the Results window, and the Browse tool Data Profiling. The default settings depend on the language that you select for the Designer interface, but you can always update the defaults.


Visit [Localization User Settings](https://help.alteryx.com/current/designer/user-settings#localization "Localization User Settings") for details.


#### International Numeric Separator Support


The ToNumber and ToString Conversion functions were updated to support conversion to and from a wide range of numeric formats (including international formats). Visit [Conversion functions](/20231/designer/conversion-functions "Conversion functions") for details.
